    <h2>Is your office too cold?</h2>

    <img src="cold1.jpg" width="300px">
    <h4>Answer</h4>
    <p><mark>This is because the algorithms that dictate temperature regulation in many office buildings were designed in the 1960s for a 154 pound male.</mark> Women, who typically have smaller frames and less muscle mass, naturally feel a bit colder than men do. This, along with faulty climate control systems, leads to many women feeling uncomfortably cold at the office.
    </p>
    <p>The effects of temperature go beyond comfort and have a measurable impact on performance. A 2004 Cornell Study found “that when ambient office temperature [was] increased from 68 degrees to 77 degrees Fahrenheit, typing errors fell by 44 percent and typing productivity increased by 150%”.</p>
